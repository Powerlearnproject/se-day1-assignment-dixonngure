#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the art of developing, testing, and maintaing software applications.
Innovation - Software Engineering enables development of new technology.
Security - As tech evolves so do cyber threats. Skilled software engineers ensure systems are secure and free from threats.
Employment Opportunities - The demand for skilled software engineers ensures that multiple people can get a sustainable livelihood.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

High level programming languages - Before high-level programming languages, developers used low-level assembly language, which was cumbersome and error-prone. The introduction of high-level languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) revolutionised software development by making it more accessible, efficient, and readable.

The Software Crisis and Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):
As software projects grew in complexity, many failed due to poor management and lack of standardized practices. This led to the "software crisis." In response, structured programming emerged, emphasizing modular design, clear logic, and systematic development processes. This period also saw the rise of methodologies like Waterfall.

The Rise of Agile and DevOps (2000s-Present):
Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by prioritizing iterative progress, customer feedback, and flexibility over rigid planning. Later, DevOps integrated development and operations teams to streamline workflows, automate processes, and improve deployment efficiency. These approaches have become industry standards for delivering high-quality software quickly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Define project goals, scope, and resources.  
Analysis: Gather and document requirements.  
Design: Create system architecture and design specifications.  
Implementation: Write and build the code.  
Testing: Verify the system works as intended.  
Deployment: Release the software to users.  
Maintenance: Fix issues and update the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It works well for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, like building a bridge or launching a satellite. For example, constructing a government system with strict regulations would suit Waterfall because changes are costly and rare.

Agile is iterative and flexible, breaking projects into small increments with continuous feedback and adjustments. It’s ideal for projects with evolving requirements, like software for startups or apps. For example, developing a mobile app where user feedback shapes features would benefit from Agile, as it allows frequent updates and adaptability.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developers design, code, and maintain software applications. They collaborate with team members to translate requirements into functional code, debug issues, and ensure the software meets performance standards. 

QA Engineers test software to identify bugs, ensure functionality, and verify that it meets user requirements. They create test cases, perform manual and automated testing, and document defects.

The role of a project manager is to oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. They coordinate between team members, set timelines, allocate resources, and manage risks. Their role is to ensure projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one platform. They enhance productivity by offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging, making development faster and more efficient. Some examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse 

VCS like Git and SVN track changes to code, enabling collaboration and preventing data loss. They allow developers to work on different features simultaneously, merge changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers often face challenges like tight deadlines, unclear requirements, and technical debt. To overcome these, effective communication with stakeholders is key to clarifying requirements. Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks helps meet deadlines without compromising quality. Regularly refactoring code and conducting code reviews can mitigate technical debt, ensuring the software remains maintainable and scalable.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work as intended.
Integration Testing: Verifies that different modules or services work together correctly and ensures seamless interaction between components.
System Testing: Evaluates the entire system’s functionality against requirements and makes sure the software works as a whole in a real-world environment.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective inputs for AI models. It's essential because it helps achieve the desired output, guides the AI's behavior, and improves the accuracy and relevance of the AI's responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it:
- Clearly specifies what aspect of AI to discuss.
- Defines the key terms (supervised and unsupervised learning).
- Narrows down the scope, making it easier for the AI to provide a focused and relevant response.
